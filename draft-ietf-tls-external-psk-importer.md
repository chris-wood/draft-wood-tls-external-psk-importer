TLS 1.3.

# Introduction

TLS 1.3 {{!RFC8446}} supports pre-shared key (PSK) authentication, wherein PSKs
can be established via session tickets from prior connections or externally via some out-of-band
mechanism. The protocol mandates that each PSK only be used with a single hash function.
This was done to simplify protocol analysis. TLS 1.2 {{!RFC5246}}, in contrast, has no such requirement, as
a PSK may be used with any hash algorithm and the TLS 1.2 PRF. This means that external PSKs
could possibly be re-used in two different contexts with the same hash functions during key
derivation. Moreover, it requires external PSKs to be provisioned for specific hash
functions.

To mitigate these problems, external PSKs can be bound to a specific KDF and hash function
when used in TLS 1.3, even if they are associated with a different hash function when provisioned.
This document specifies an interface by which external PSKs may be imported for use in a TLS 1.3 connection
to achieve this goal. In particular, it describes how KDF-bound PSKs can be differentiated by
the target (D)TLS protocol version and KDF for which the PSK will be used. This produces a set
of candidate PSKs, each of which are bound to a specific target protocol and KDF. This expands what
would normally have been a single PSK identity into a set of PSK identities.

# Conventions and Definitions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 {{RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}}
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

# Overview

Key importers mirror the concept of key exporters in TLS in that they diversify a key
based on some contextual information before use in a connection. In contrast to key exporters,
wherein differentiation is done via an explicit label and context string, the key importer
defined herein diversifies external one PSK into one or more PSKs for use via a target protocol,
KDF identifier, and optional context string. Additionally, the resulting PSK binder key is modified
with a new derivation label to prevent confusion with non-imported PSKs.

Imported keys do not require negotiation for use, as a client and server will not agree upon
identities if not imported correctly. Endpoints may incrementally deploy PSK importer support
by offering non-imported keys for TLS versions prior to TLS 1.3. Non-imported and imported PSKs
are distinct since their identities are different on the wire. See {{rollout}} for more details.

Clients which import external keys TLS MUST NOT use these keys for any other purpose.
Moreover, each external PSK MUST be associated with at most one hash function.

## Terminology {#terminology}

- External PSK (EPSK): A PSK established or provisioned out-of-band, i.e., not from a TLS
connection, which is a tuple of (Base Key, External Identity, Hash).
- Base Key: The secret value of an EPSK.
- External Identity: The identity of an EPSK.
- Target protocol: The protocol for which a PSK is imported for use.
- Target KDF: The KDF for which a PSK is imported for use.
- Imported PSK (IPSK): A PSK derived from an EPSK, external identity, optional context string,
and target protocol and KDF.
- Imported Identity: The identity of an Imported PSK as sent on the wire.

# Key Import

A key importer diversifies an input EPSK into one or more PSKs advertised on the wire via
a target protocol, KDF identifier, and optional context string. Additionally, the resulting
PSK binder key is modified with a new derivation label to prevent confusion with non-imported
PSKs. This section describes the diversification mechanism and binder key computation change.

## External PSK Diversification

A key importer takes as input an EPSK with external identity `external_identity` and base key `epsk`,
as defined in {{terminology}}, along with an optional context, and transforms it into a set of PSKs
and imported identities for use in a connection based on supported (target) protocols and KDFs. In particular,
for each supported target protocol `target_protocol` and KDF `target_kdf`, the importer constructs
an ImportedIdentity structure as follows:

~~~
struct {
   opaque external_identity<1...2^16-1>;
   opaque context<0..2^16-1>;
   uint16 target_protocol;
   uint16 target_kdf;
} ImportedIdentity;
~~~

The list of `target_kdf` values is maintained by IANA as described in {{IANA}}. External PSKs MUST NOT
be imported for (D)TLS 1.2 or prior versions. See {{rollout}} for discussion on
how imported PSKs for TLS 1.3 and non-imported PSKs for earlier versions co-exist for incremental
deployment.

ImportedIdentity.context MUST include the context used to derive the EPSK, if any exists.
For example, ImportedIdentity.context may include information about peer roles or identities
to mitigate Selfie-style reflection attacks. See {{mitigate-selfie}} for more details.
If the EPSK is a key derived from some other protocol or sequence of protocols,
ImportedIdentity.context MUST include a channel binding for the deriving protocols
{{!RFC5056}}.

ImportedIdentity.target_protocol MUST be the (D)TLS protocol version for which the
PSK is being imported. For example, TLS 1.3 {{!RFC8446}} and QUICv1 {{!QUIC=I-D.ietf-quic-transport}}
use 0x0304. Note that this means future versions of TLS will increase the number of PSKs
derived from an external PSK.

An Imported PSK derived from an EPSK with base key 'epsk' bound to this identity is then
computed as follows:

~~~
   epskx = HKDF-Extract(0, epsk)
   ipskx = HKDF-Expand-Label(epskx, "derived psk",
                             Hash(ImportedIdentity), L)
~~~

L is corresponds to the KDF output length of ImportedIdentity.target_kdf as defined in {{IANA}}.
For hash-based KDFs, such as HKDF_SHA256(0x0001), this is the length of the hash function
output, i.e., 32 octets. This is required for the IPSK to be of length suitable for supported
ciphersuites.

The identity of 'ipskx' as sent on the wire is ImportedIdentity, i.e., the serialized content
of ImportedIdentity is used as the content of PskIdentity.identity in the PSK extension.

The hash function used for HKDF {{!RFC5869}} is that which is associated with the EPSK.
It is not the hash function associated with ImportedIdentity.target_kdf. If no hash function
is specified, SHA-256 MUST be used. Diversifying EPSK by ImportedIdentity.target_kdf ensures
that an IPSK is only used as input keying material to at most one KDF, thus satisfying
the requirements in {{!RFC8446}}.

Endpoints generate a compatible ipskx for each target ciphersuite they offer. For example, importing a
key for TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 and TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 would yield two PSKs, one for HKDF-SHA256 and
another for HKDF-SHA384. In contrast, if TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 and TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256
are supported, only one derived key is necessary.

The resulting IPSK base key 'ipskx' is then used as the binder key in TLS 1.3 with identity
ImportedIdentity. With knowledge of the supported KDFs, one may import PSKs before the start
of a connection.

EPSKs may be imported for early data use if they are bound to protocol settings and configurations that would
otherwise be required for early data with normal (ticket-based PSK) resumption. Minimally, that means ALPN,
QUIC transport settings, etc., must be provisioned alongside these EPSKs.

## Binder Key Derivation

To prevent PSK Importers from being confused with standard out-of-band PSKs, imported PSKs
change the PSK binder key derivation label. In particular, the standard TLS 1.3 PSK binder key
computation is defined as follows:

~~~
             0
             |
             v
   PSK ->  HKDF-Extract = Early Secret
             |
             +-----> Derive-Secret(., "ext binder" | "res binder", "")
             |                     = binder_key
             V
~~~

Imported PSKs replace the string "ext binder" with "imp binder" when deriving `binder_key`.
This means the binder key is now computed as follows:

~~~
             0
             |
             v
   PSK ->  HKDF-Extract = Early Secret
             |
             +-----> Derive-Secret(., "ext binder"
             |                      | "res binder"
             |                      | "imp binder", "")
             |                     = binder_key
             V
~~~

This new label differentiates non-imported and imported external PSKs. Specifically, a client and
server will negotiate use of an external PSK if and only if (a) both endpoints import the PSK or
(b) neither endpoint imports the PSK. As `binder_key` is a leaf key, changing its computation does
not affect any other key.

# Deprecating Hash Functions

If a client or server wish to deprecate a hash function and no longer use it for TLS 1.3,
they remove the corresponding KDF from the set of target KDFs used for importing keys.
This does not affect the KDF operation used to derive Imported PSKs.

# Incremental Deployment {#rollout}

Recall that TLS 1.2 permits computing the TLS PRF with any hash algorithm and PSK.
Thus, an EPSK may be used with the same KDF (and underlying HMAC hash algorithm)
as TLS 1.3 with importers. However, critically, the derived PSK will not be the same since
the importer differentiates the PSK via the identity, target protocol, and target KDF. Thus,
PSKs imported for TLS 1.3 are distinct from those used in TLS 1.2, and thereby avoid
cross-protocol collisions. Note that this does not preclude endpoints from using non-imported
PSKs for TLS 1.2. Indeed, this is necessary for incremental deployment.

# Security Considerations

The Key Importer security goals can be roughly stated as follows: avoid PSK re-use across
KDFs while properly authenticating endpoints. When modeled as computational extractors, KDFs
assume that input keying material (IKM) is sampled from some "source" probability distribution
and that any two IKM values are chosen independently of each other {{Kraw10}}. This
source-independence requirement implies that the same IKM value cannot be used for two different
KDFs.

PSK-based authentication is functionally equivalent to session resumption in that a connection
uses existing key material to authenticate both endpoints. Following the work of
{{?BAA15=DOI.10.14722/ndss.2015.23277}}, this is a form of compound authentication. Loosely
speaking, compound authentication is the property that an execution of multiple authentication
protocols, wherein at least one is uncompromised, jointly authenticates all protocols.
Authenticating with an externally provisioned PSK, therefore, should ideally authenticate both
the TLS connection and the external provision process. Typically, the external provision process
produces a PSK and corresponding context from which the PSK was derived and in which it should
be used. We refer to an external PSK without such context as "context free".

Thus, in considering the source-independence and compound authentication requirements, the Key
Import API described in this document aims to achieve the following goals:

1. Externally provisioned PSKs imported into TLS achieve compound authentication of the
provision step(s) and connection.
2. Context-free PSKs only achieve authentication within the context of a single connection.
3. Imported PSKs are used as IKM for two different KDFs.
4. Imported PSKs do not collide with existing PSKs used for TLS 1.2 and below.
5. Imported PSKs do not collide with future protocol versions and KDFs.

# Privacy Considerations

External PSK identities are typically static by design so that endpoints may use them to
lookup keying material. However, for some systems and use cases, this identity may become a
persistent tracking identifier.

# IANA Considerations {#IANA}

This specification introduces a new registry for TLS KDF identifiers and defines the following
target KDF values:

| KDF Description    | Value  |
|:-------------------|:-------|
| Reserved           | 0x0000 |
| HKDF_SHA256        | 0x0001 |
| HKDF_SHA384        | 0x0002 |
{: #kdf-registry title="Target KDF Registry"}

New target KDF values are allocated according to the following process:

- Values in the range 0x0000-0xfeff are assigned via Specification Required {{!RFC8126}}.
- Values in the range 0xff00-0xffff are reserved for Private Use {{!RFC8126}}.

# Addressing Selfie {#mitigate-selfie}

The Selfie attack {{Selfie}} relies on a misuse of the PSK interface.
The PSK interface makes the implicit assumption that each PSK
is known only to one client and one server. If multiple clients or
multiple servers with distinct roles share a PSK, TLS only
authenticates the entire group. A node successfully authenticates
its peer as being in the group whether the peer is another node or itself.

Applications which require authenticating finer-grained roles while still
configuring a single shared PSK across all nodes can resolve this
mismatch either by exchanging roles over the TLS connection after
the handshake or by incorporating the roles of both the client and server
into the IPSK context string. For instance, if an application
identifies each node by MAC address, it could use the following context string.

~~~
  struct {
    opaque client_mac<0..2^16-1>;
    opaque server_mac<0..2^16-1>;
  } Context;
~~~

If an attacker then redirects a ClientHello intended for one node to a different
node, the receiver will compute a different context string and the handshake
will not complete.

Note that, in this scenario, there is still a single shared PSK across all nodes,
so each node must be trusted not to impersonate another node's role.
